### **CPU-Centric Questions**
1. **Which CPU has the highest total busy time (`busy_time_ns`)?**  
   *Compare the `busy_time_ns` values across all CPU nodes.*

2. **Which CPU has the highest average busy time per thread (`avg_busy_time_per_thread_ns`)?**  
   *Use the `avg_busy_time_per_thread_ns` attribute of CPU nodes.*

3. **What is the total number of edge occurrences (`total_edge_occurrences`) for CPU 2?**  
   *Directly read the `total_edge_occurrences` value of the CPU 2 node.*

4. **Which CPU has the highest maximum average edge time (`max_avg_edge_time_ns`)?**  
   *Compare the `max_avg_edge_time_ns` values across CPUs.*

5. **How many unique threads (`num_unique_threads`) are running on CPU 3?**  
   *Check the `num_unique_threads` attribute of the CPU 3 node.*

### **Thread-Centric Questions**
6. **Which thread has the highest peak accumulated time on CPU 0?**  
   *Find the thread with the largest last value in `accumulated_times` for links targeting CPU 0.*

7. **Which threads are shared across multiple CPUs?**  
   *Identify threads with `used_cpu` links to more than one CPU.*

8. **What is the peak accumulated time of thread T_0 across all CPUs?**  
   *Check the last value of `accumulated_times` in all `used_cpu` links for T_0 and pick the maximum.*

9. **Which thread has the highest single occurrence time (`time_per_occurrence`) on CPU 1?**  
   *Find the maximum numeric value in `time_per_occurrence` arrays for threads linked to CPU 1 (ignore "N/A").*

10. **How many threads have a peak accumulated time >1e9 ns on CPU 2?**  
    *Filter threads linked to CPU 2 where the last `accumulated_times` value exceeds 1e9 ns.*

### **System-Wide Analysis**
11. **What is the total busy time across all CPUs?**  
    *Sum the `busy_time_ns` values of all CPU nodes.*

12. **What is the ratio of total edge occurrences to unique threads for CPU 0?**  
    *Calculate `total_edge_occurrences / num_unique_threads` for CPU 0.*

13. **Which CPU is the most utilized (busy time per unique thread)?**  
    *Compute `busy_time_ns / num_unique_threads` for each CPU and compare.*

14. **What is the distribution of threads across CPUs?**  
    *List the `num_unique_threads` for each CPU node.*

15. **What is the average `max_avg_edge_time_ns` across all CPUs?**  
    *Average the `max_avg_edge_time_ns` values of all CPUs.*

### **How to Answer These Questions**  
Each question can be addressed by:  
1. Parsing the relevant CPU/Thread nodes and their attributes.  
2. Filtering/aggregating `links` based on `relation`, `source`, and `target`.  
3. Using the last value of `accumulated_times` for peak usage analysis.  
4. Applying arithmetic operations (sum, max, average) on numeric attributes like `busy_time_ns`.

These questions enable deep insights into CPU utilization, thread behavior, and system performance! ðŸš€
